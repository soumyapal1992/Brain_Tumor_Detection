# Brain_Tumor_Detection
This .ipynb file contains the code of a Proposed Convolutional Neural Network Model which is build based in VGG19 Model architecture. This model can detect Brain Tumor from a given 
Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection) of MRI images and can classify it into two categories "Tumor" and "No Tumor".
Change the path of the datasets as per your requirement in the .ipynb file.
